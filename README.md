# QExe
Qt-based C++ library for modifying PE32 executable files.

Please note that this library exclusively works with PE32 executable files.  
Attempting to open PE32+ files will cause an error, and trying to open anything that uses CLR will obviously not work either.

(more details will be added when this library is actually ready for use)
